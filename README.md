We also visulaized few more aspects of our pizza sales like daily trends, monthly trends for total orders and few more by using PowerBI tool to understand trends.

### Conclusions
 According to the analysed data it can be determined that large pizza has been purchased more compared to other sizes, sales of pizza is more in spring compared to fall.  Also it is evident that maximum revenue is from Thai Chicken Pizza and minimum from Brie Care Pizza, these insights may help the pizza store to meet the customer demands in future.
